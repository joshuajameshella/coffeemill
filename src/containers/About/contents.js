            "Welcome to The Coffee Mill! My little coffee shop that has become a place where people can come and relax, meet friends and family, and enjoy a delicious cup of coffee & home-baked treat.",
            "Every single cake and treat that we sell is home-baked daily by myself. I never use packet mixes. Everything is made from scratch using the best ingredients I can. The eggs are free range, the honey is from our garden (so couldn’t really get more local), and when I can, I use home-grown fruit and herbs."

            "I don’t have any formal training in cookery, I was taught to bake by my grandma, basically as soon as I could stand. I don’t remember a time when we weren’t baking, and experimenting in her kitchen. My grandma definitely supported my passion for baking, always helping and encouraging me along the way. It was always our dream to open a coffee shop and bakery, and I hope I made her proud.",
