# Coffee Mill and Cakes

This is the front-end website for The Coffee Mill & Cakes; a small local coffee shop & bakery.

The website is built on the React framework, and will expand in scope to be a full-stack MERN application, using a back-end running MongoDB to store the website information & product data.

## Running the project:

To run the project, first clone the repository onto your local machine.

You will need to create a `credentials.js` file in the project root, containing your own exported `MapboxAccessToken` variable. [Available Here.](https://www.mapbox.com/)

Finally, run the following commands: `npm install` & `npm start`. The project should be running on `localhost:3000`

## :construction: Project under construction :construction:

At the moment, data on the website is retrieved from hard-coded JavaScript files.

This is a temporary solution, and will be replaced with API calls to a server running a Node, Express & MongoDB application.
