# Coffee Mill and Cakes

This is the website & API repository for The Coffee Mill & Cakes; a small local coffee shop & bakery.

The website is built on the React framework, and connects to a back-end API using a MongoDB database, accessible via an Express.js server framework running inside a node.js application. 
The two come together to form a Full-Stack MERN application.

## Website

As mentioned above, the website is built on the React framework.
The website itself has a simple design and, where possible, makes use of well-tested external libraries such as Material-UI & Mapbox.

### Running the project:

- To run the project, first clone the repository onto your local machine.

- Install `node_modules` by running the following command: `npm install` in the project root.

- If installation is successful, run the project: `npm run start`

The Coffee Mill & Cakes website should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`

##  :construction: Project under construction  :construction:

At the moment, data on the website is retrieved from hard-coded JavaScript files.

This is a temporary solution, and will be replaced with API calls to a server running a Node, Express & MongoDB application.
